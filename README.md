# MoulsonBot Discord Bot

A new version of the discord bot I started a while ago

The main purpose of this bot is for me to get better with Ruby on Rails
The old bot was a mess and I am attempting to creater a cleaner version with this one

It's not supposed to be state of the art, it's a side project for me to explore different technologies.

If for some reason you want to run this yourself, create a config file at `/config/settings.yml`
and include these values:

* `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: '<your bot's token>'`
* `MASTER_USER_ID: '<your discord user id>'`
